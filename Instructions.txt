Here are the instructions for the deployment of the project on the github.

STEP 1: CREATE or OPEN your github account.
STEP 2: Create a PUBLIC repository for your website with the appropiate name.
STEP 3: Push your code to the public repository by following commands.

        git init // To initialize github repository.
        git add . // To add your code for the website into the staging area of github for tracking of files.
        git commit -m "message" // Commit your code to the github repository with appropiate commit message.

        git remote add origin <github-repository-url> // To add the remote url for the repository.
        git branch -M master // To create a master branch on the repository
        git push -u origin master // To push your code to the repository

STEP 5: After pushing the code onto the repository, refresh the code page in your repository to look for the code files.

STEP 6: Click on the settings tab and scroll down to the github pages. Inside source select your branch as master instead of none and wait for 5mins for publishing your website.

After the website is published following message would be displayed. 
"Your site is published at https://user-name.github.io/repository-name/"
